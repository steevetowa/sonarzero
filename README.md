SONARZERO: Car Insurance Claim Prediction Model
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model developed to predict the likelihood of a car insurance policy resulting in a claim. The model is based on logistic regression and is designed to assist underwriters in assessing the risk associated with each insurance policy. By analyzing historical policyholder data and claims, the model provides a probability score that indicates the likelihood of a claim being made during the policy period.

Features

•	Machine Learning Algorithm: Logistic Regression (binary classification)

•	Input Data: Historical policyholder data such as:
  o	Driver age, driving history, vehicle age, etc.
  o	Policy information (coverage type, premium amount, duration)
  o	External data like geographic location, weather patterns, or accident statistics

•	Output: A probability score between 0 and 1 indicating the likelihood of a claim.
  o	0: Low probability of a claim.
  o	1: High probability of a claim.

Installation

To use this model, you need to set up a Python environment with the required dependencies.

1.	Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/steevetowa/sonarzero.git
cd sonarzero

2.	Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.	Run the model: Load your dataset in the provided format, run the training script, and evaluate the model's performance.
Usage

For Underwriters
The model can be integrated into underwriting systems to enhance risk assessment processes. When an underwriter inputs policyholder details into the model, it returns the probability of a claim being filed during the policy period. Based on this score, underwriters can:

•	Adjust premiums to reflect the risk level.

•	Decide whether to accept or reject a policy application.

•	Recommend risk mitigation strategies for high-risk clients.

Running Predictions
After training the model on your dataset, you have to first identify the labels for each of the 10 parameters used for the model, then you can use it to predict the outcome of a new policy with “0” for no-claim, and “1” for at least 1 claim for new policyholders by running a code similar to:
python
Copy code
import sonarzero

# Example policyholder data
policyholder_data = {
    "sex": 0,
    "type_vehicule": 33,
    "make": 5,
    "insured_value": 100,000,
    "premium": 1200,
    "usage": 2
}

# Predict the claim probability
result = sonarzero.predict(policyholder_data)
print(f"Policy Result: ", result)

Model Retraining
To keep the model relevant, periodic retraining with fresh data is recommended. The model can be retrained using the train.py script with new historical data, adjusting for any trends in claims behavior.

Evaluation
The model performance can be evaluated using metrics such as:

•	Accuracy

•	Precision & Recall

•	F1 Score

•	ROC-AUC Curve

These metrics help determine the effectiveness of the model in identifying high-risk policyholders.
Future Development

•	Feature Engineering: Additional features like telematics data or social media sentiment analysis can be incorporated to improve accuracy.

•	Model Tuning: Hyperparameter optimization can further refine the logistic regression model.

•	Model Deployment: Convert the model into an API or integrate it into existing underwriting software for real-time predictions.
